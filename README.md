# task2 Swagger codegen.

Create the same REST API as in task #1, but use https://editor.swagger.io/ to create your API
definition and generate the server code. Choose any java-based server or server framework,
that you like. You can either use the online editor or generate the code manually, e.g. using this
document: https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/wiki/server-stub-generator-howto.
Make sure that you can deploy/run the generated code. Once your stub is ready - implement the
same functionality as described in task #1, but now in java.
Finally, be sure that you can show how your application responds to requests using postman,
curl or any other HTTP client.

To create the same REST API as in task #1 using Swagger Codegen, we can follow these steps:

1. Go to https://editor.swagger.io/ and create a new API definition.
2. Define the endpoints for GET, PUT, and DELETE operations on server objects, along with the required parameters and response models.
3. Generate the server code using Swagger Codegen, selecting any Java-based server or server framework.
4. Implement the business logic for the server operations in Java.
5. Test the API using Postman or any other HTTP client.
